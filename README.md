# ALGOBULLS_PYTHON_DEVELOPER_ASSIGNMENT
Jupyter Notebook for Algobulls python developer assignment.
In this Assignment I have used Alpha vantage api to fetch intraday trading timeseries data of the required stocks.
Once the data is fetched it is converted to a dataframe. A moving average is calculated based on the closing price in the data frame and a Strategy is used to flag a BUY or SELL signal.
